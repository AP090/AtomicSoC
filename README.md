# AtomicSoC
Projects for the FPGA control system for the DE0-Nano and DE10-Nano that compile on Quartus Prime Lite 21. Switching to other versions of Quartus should be simple enough. Note that one file in each project exceeded 100 MB (the maximum file size allowed on GitHub), so I compressed it into a subfolder. Per my testing, though, it didn't seem essential to the project. I've also added the fifo_test file that allows for SSH-based communication.
